# ATM_Machine_Simulation
This repository features a basic Java-based ATM simulation that demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts. The program allows users to check their account balance, withdraw and deposit cash, change their PIN, and view transaction history. The project provides practical experience in handling user inputs and managing data structures.
